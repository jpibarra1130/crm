# CRM

This is an exercise project for the [React Native Linkedin Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/create-a-crm-mobile-application-with-react-native-2) course.

# Notes:
Deviation from course:
- Converted navigation to React Navigation 5.0 instead of React Navigation 4.0
- Used native-base as opposed to react-native-material-kit because of issues I've encountered when running it in iOS.
